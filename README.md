# JLDialect: Jeolla Dialect ↔ Standard Korean Converter

## 📝 Overview
JLDialect is a small AI/NLP project that converts sentences between  
**Jeolla dialect (Southwestern Korean)** and **Standard Korean**.

This project was inspired by my desire to communicate more smoothly with my grandmother,  
who speaks in the Jeolla dialect. I wanted to build a simple tool that bridges the gap  
between dialect speakers and younger generations who mainly use Standard Korean.
